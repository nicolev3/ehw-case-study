Our energy quickly bounced into a frenzy when sharing a room with the Essential Health & Wellness team. They sought our help to establish the  mason work for the organization’s marketing foundation. Their outreach was spearheaded by a dramatic need for some immediate, effective marketing effort, on the heels of a business deal gone astray. This quickly evolved into a consultative review of the entire marketing infrastructure.

Essential Health & Wellness was not adequately prepared to counter
multiple headwinds to its growth aspirations and was struggling with establishing the roots of
its own identity. <!--These included:
<ul><li> A budding franchise idea with no viable business model to support it.</li>
<li>A dwindling total potential market with no clear route into the market that exists.</li>
<li>New, aggressive competitors in a previously high-barrier-to-entry space.</li>
<li>An uncertain or tenuous competitive differentiation.</li>
<li>Government and socioeconomic factors weighing heavily upon the business's future
as a “luxury” or offering currently marketed to the wealthy.</li>
Root Cause : Essential Health & Wellness has not had a business or marketing strategy,
tactics, or groundwork prepared in recent history.
